However, two weeks later, Sharma was impressed by Kohli's accuracy and power in throwing.Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in the gully cricket.Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team,not due to a lack of merit but due to extraneous factors</p>
